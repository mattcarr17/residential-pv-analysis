# Residential PV Analysis

## Overview

Residential solar offers an incredible opportunity to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. These small-scale, distributed systems have the potential to generate up to 25% of all electricity currently consumed in the US, dramatically reducing GHG emissions from electricity generation. The US has barely scratched the surface of the potential for residential PV. This project focuses on what we can do to drive growth in residential PV across the United States.
